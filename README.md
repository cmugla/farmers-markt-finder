# Farmer's Market Finder
  
  A mobile app for Farmer's Market enthusiasts.

  When opened, the app uses geolocation to show the user's nearby Farmer's markets that are currently happening. As a farmer, you can add your Farm to the Farmer's Market you have a booth at. When a user clicks on a market, all relevant info about that market show, including the location, contact info, and hours; as well as any recent posts made by their farmers. Users can save their favorite market and follow their favorite farms. If they are following a farm, they'll see their posts on their feed when the app is opened.
